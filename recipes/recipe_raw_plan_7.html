  <h1>Recipe Raw Plan 7</h1>
  <h3>Goal: pancakes</h3>

    <section class="plans">

    <p>
      Ingredients: 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon white sugar, ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste, 1 ¼ cups milk, 3 tablespoons butter, melted, 1 egg.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth. \n 2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.

      Ingredients: 2 cups all purpose flour, ¼ cup granulated sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder, ¼ teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 ¾ cups milk, ¼ cup butter, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1 large egg.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg. \n 2. Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay). \n 3. Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. \n 4. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup. \n 5. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter. \n 6. Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!

      Ingredients: 2 cups all purpose flour, 4 teaspoons baking powder, ¼ cup sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 large eggs, 1.5 cups milk, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, vegetable oil.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. \n 2. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until evenly combined. \n 3. Pour the milk/egg mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. If the batter seems too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk. \n 4. Heat a griddle or nonstick pan over medium heat; coat it lightly with vegetable oil and swirl in a thin pat of butter. Ladle or drop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately ¼ cup for each pancake; cook until the first side is golden brown, or until the top surface bubbles and is dotted with holes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. This happens quickly so peek after 30 seconds and watch carefully! Adjust the heat setting if necessary. Wipe the griddle clean with a paper towel between batches. Serve immediately with maple syrup.

      Ingredients: 2 cups flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 2 eggs, ¼ cup butter, 1 ¾ cups milk.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Mix the dry items first. \n 2. Combine the eggs and melted butter to the milk and slowly stir into the flour mixture. \n 3. Heat the griddle to325 F or the pan to medium high let sit at least 10 minutes while heating the griddle orpan. \n 4. These will be high, but light and fluffy.

      Ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, milk, egg, butter, vanilla extract.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Melt the butter and set it aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. \n 2. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. (Don’t worry if the butter solidifies slightly). \n 3. Create a well in the center of your dry ingredients. Pour in the milk mixture and stir gently with a fork until the flour is just incorporated. A few small lumps are okay. As the batter sits, it should start to bubble. \n 4. Place a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Sprinkle in a few drops of water to test if it’s ready. You want them to dance around a bit and evaporate. \n 5. Brush the skillet with melted butter (this creates crispy edges, but you can skip it if using a quality nonstick pan). \n 6. Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a 1/4 cup measure or large cookie scoop, and spread each pancake into a 4-inch circle. \n 7. After 1 to 2 minutes, the edges will look dry, and bubbles will form and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. \n 8. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and berries.
