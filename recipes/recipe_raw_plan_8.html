      Ingredients: 2 slices sourdough bread, 2 tbsp salted butter, ⅓ cup vintage cheddar cheese, ⅓ cup mozzarella.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Butter bread – Slather both sides of each piece of bread with the butter (yes, all 4 sides!). \n 2. Light toast – Heat a heavy-based skillet or frying pan over medium low heat (no oil or butter). Place both pieces of bread in the skillet and lightly toast for 1 minute to warm it through and create a light crust. (When we flip, this gives the cheese a head start). \n 3. Pile on cheese – Flip one slice of bread, then pile on the cheddar cheese followed by the mozzarella. Place the other slice of bread on top, with the hot toasted side in contact with the cheese. \n 4. Cook 3 minutes – Cook for 3 minutes or until the bread is evenly golden and crisp, pressing down lightly with a spatula every now and then. If it's browning too quickly, remove remove from the stove to cool down a bit and lower heat. \n 5. Flip, 3 minutes – Turn the sandwich over, and cook the other side for 3 minutes or until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted. \n 6. Devour – Transfer to cutting board. Cut in half in one swift motion. Admire cheese pull. Devour. Repeat.

      Ingredients: 4 slices bread of your choice, 4 slices mozzarella cheese, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, ½ teaspoon oregano, ½ to 1 teaspoon chili flakes, ½ teaspoon black pepper.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Start with your oven set to 450 F or 220 C. Or if using a sandwich toaster, preheat it. \n 2. Generously butter your bread and assemble your sandwiches, by placing the buttered side down on a baking sheet or a tray. \n 3. Place the cheese slices and add your spices or herbs of choice, if you want to. Cover with another bread slice, with the buttered side on top. \n 4. Place tray on the middle rack of your oven and toast until the bread begins to turn golden brown, about 3 to 5 mins. If you are using a OTG, it just takes about 3 to 4 mins. \n 5. Flip once with a wooden spatula and continue to grill until the cheese is visibly melted and your sandwich has developed an even, light brown color. This takes another 3 to 5 mins depending on your bread and oven. \n 6. Remove and let cool down a wired rack before you cut and enjoy hot! Repeat.
