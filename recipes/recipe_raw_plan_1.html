  <h1>Recipe Raw Plan 1</h1>  
    <section class="plans">
      <p>
        Ingredients: 2 and 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch, ½ teaspoon salt, ¾ cup (170g) unsalted butter, melted & cooled 5 minutes, ¾ cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar, ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar, 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature, 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1 and ¼ cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks.
        Instructions: 1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. \n 2. In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine them. \n 3. Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days. I highly recommend chilling the cookie dough overnight for less spreading. \n 4. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at room temperature for 10 minutes. \n 5. Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. \n 6. Using a cookie scoop or Tablespoon measuring spoon, measure 3 scant Tablespoons (about 2 ounces, or 60g) of dough for XL cookies or 2 heaping Tablespoons (about 1.75 ounces, or 50g) of dough for medium/large cookies. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker. Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie sheet. \n 7. Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned. (XL cookies can take closer to 14 minutes.) The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. \n 8. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.

        Ingredients: 1 cup salted butter (softened), 1 cup granulated sugar, 1 cup light brown sugar (packed), 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 2 large eggs, 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon sea salt, 2 cups chocolate chips (14 oz)
        Instructions: 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. \n 2. In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. \n 3. Cream together butter and sugars until combined. \n 4. Beat in eggs and vanilla until light (about 1 minute). \n 5. Mix in the dry ingredients until combined. \n 6. Add chocolate chips and mix well. \n 7. Roll 2-3 tablespoons (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets. \n 8. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just barely starting to turn brown. \n 9. Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.

        Ingredients: 8 tablespoons of salted butter, 1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture), 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 egg, 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces), 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra), 3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks).
        Instructions: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form. \n 2. Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff). \n 3. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands. \n 4. Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy. \n 5. Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.

        Ingredients: 3/4 cup salted butter softened, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 egg, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup favorite chocolate chips.
        Instructions: 1. Preheat the oven to 350° F. \n 2. In the bowl of a stand mixer or with an electric hand mixer, cream together the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until light in color and fluffy in texture. \n 3. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add in the egg and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.
        Add in the flour, soda and salt. Mix until a soft but not sticky dough forms. \n 4. Fold in your favorite chocolate chips. \n 5. Scoop the dough out into 1 1/2 tbsp portions (a #40 cookie scoop works great here) and arrange on your cookie sheet. Can use parchment paper, a silicone mat or an uncreased cookie sheet. \n 6. Bake at 350° F for 8-10 minutes or until the cookies have spread and are just beginning to turn golden brown on the edges. \n 7. Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack.

        Ingredients: ½ cup granulated sugar, ¾ cup brown sugar, packed, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ cup unsalted butter melted, 1 large egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks, 4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference.
        Instructions: 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. \n 2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. \n 3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies). \n 4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. \n 5. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. \n 6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. \n 7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown. \n 8. Cool completely before serving. \n 9. Enjoy!
