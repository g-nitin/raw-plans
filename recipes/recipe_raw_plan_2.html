    <p>
      Ingredients: 2 large eggs, Pinch fine sea salt, 1/2 Tbsp unsalted butter, 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella low moisture part-skim.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. In a small mixing bowl, beat together eggs and a pinch of salt until foamy. \n 2. Place a small nonstick skillet over medium heat and swirl in 1/2 Tbsp butter. Once butter is melted and bubbling, add frothy eggs to the skillet and immediately reduce the heat to low. \n 3. Use a spatula to pull the cooked eggs into the center, letting the liquid egg fill the space behind it. Continue going around the pan, pulling the eggs towards the center until the eggs are nearly set. \n 4. Once the omelette is sliding around the pan easily and you can get a spatula underneath, flip the omelette over and turn off the heat. \n 5. Sprinkle cheese over the egg and add your favorite toppings. Fold the omelette in half and slide it onto your plate then garnish as desired.

      Ingredients: 2 large eggs, Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, Butter or extra-virgin olive oil, Desired fillings
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk until the egg whites and yolks are well combined. Season with salt. \n 2. Heat an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add a small pat of butter or a drizzle of olive oil to the pan and swirl to coat the bottom. Pour the eggs into the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook without stirring until the edges just begin to set, about 10 seconds. Working around the edges of the omelette, use a spatula to quickly push the cooked egg toward the center of the pan. Let the uncooked egg run to the outside of the pan, tilting the pan as necessary. Continue until the uncooked egg thickens and fills in the edges of the omelette slowly, then use the spatula to gently smooth the raw egg into an even layer. \n 3. Cook without stirring until the omelette is mostly set, then add your desired filling on one side and fold the other side over it. Cook until the eggs are just set. Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.

      Ingredients: ½ Tablespoon salted butter, 3 large eggs, Pinch salt and pepper, ¼ cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 cup vegetables diced small (bell pepper, zucchini, onion, etc.), Salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 2 Tablespoon minced onion, 2 slices bacon diced.
      <br>
      Instructions:1. Dice 1 cup of vegetables. \n 2. Over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, about 3-5 minutes depending on the vegetables you choose. Set aside. \n 3. Cook bacon (or sausage), garlic and onion over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside. \n 4. Whisk eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). Whisk in salt and pepper. \n 5. Melt butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. \n 6. Add whisked eggs and swirl the pan until they are evenly distributed. \n 7. Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook. \n 8. Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat. \n 9. Sprinkle cheese over the top of the omelette. \n 10. Then, add the toppings on one half of the omelette, and fold the other half over the toppings.

      Ingredients: 1 tbsp / 15g butter, 3 eggs, 2 tbsp cream (or 1 ½ tbsp milk), Salt and pepper, 1/3 cup grated cheese, 1 tbsp / 15g butter or olive oil, 150 g / 5 oz mushrooms sliced (about 1 ½ cups), 1 small garlic clove minced, Pinch of fresh thyme leaves and finely chopped parsley.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Mushroom Filling: Melt butter in a medium or small non stick skillet over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until starting to go golden on the edges – about 1 ½ minutes. Add garlic, salt and pepper, cook until golden – about 1 ½ minutes. Remove from skillet. \n 2.Whisk eggs, cream, salt and pepper. \n 3. Cool skillet and lower heat to medium. \n 4. Add butter, then when it foams, add egg. Immediately give it a few stirs (as though you’re making scrambled eggs) then when the base just starts to set, spread it all out to cover the base. \n 5. Wait 20 - 30 seconds, then use a rubber spatula to lift up the edge, tilt pan to make the egg run off the surface under the omelette. Repeat 2 or 3 times around the edges of the omelette. \n 6. Sprinkle half the omelette with some of the cheese, top with mushrooms, sprinkle with thyme and parsley, top with remaining cheese. \n 7. Cover with lid and cook for 30 seconds or until the underside is light golden and top is just set – cheese won’t melt. \n 8. Fold omelette in half to cover mushrooms, transfer to serving plate immediately – residual heat will melt cheese.
