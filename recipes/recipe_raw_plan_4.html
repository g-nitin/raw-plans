    Instructions: 1. Place oil in a large skillet; turn heat to medium-high. A minute later, add onions, along with a generous pinch of salt and some pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very soft and almost falling apart, 15 minutes or more. Stir in curry powder, and cook, stirring, for another minute or so. \n 2. Add coconut milk, and cook until it thickens, about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add chicken, and stir, then cook until done, 3 to 6 minutes. (If you use shrimp, keep in mind that it cooks a little faster than chicken; if you are in doubt about whether chicken is done, cut into a piece.) \n 3. Add tomato, and cook another minute; adjust seasonings as necessary. Serve over rice, garnished with basil or mint, if desired.

    Ingredients: 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs or a mix!, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 2 tablespoons coconut oil, 1 red bell pepper thinly sliced, 1 leek thinly sliced, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, 2 tablespoons red curry paste, 1 can full-fat coconut milk (14 ounces) (do not use light, or the sauce won't thicken properly), 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro torn, Prepared brown rice for serving
    <br>
    Instructions: 1. Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper. \n 2. Melt the coconut oil over medium-high heat in a large, ovenproof skillet. Add the chicken and sear on both sides until deeply golden brown. Transfer to a plate. \n 3. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the bell pepper, leek, garlic, and ginger, and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes, until slightly softened. \n 4. Stir in the curry paste. Cook for 5 additional minutes, stirring often. Slowly pour in the coconut milk while stirring to combine. Return the reserved chicken to the skillet. \n 5. Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. The chicken will be fully cooked when a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers 165°F, and the juices run clear. (Note: Smaller chicken breasts may be done closer to the 15-minute mark.) \n 6. Top with cilantro. Serve with rice, spooning lots of the yummy curry coconut milk sauce over the top.

<p>
    Ingredients: 1¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into ¼-inch strips, Salt and freshly ground black pepper, 2½ teaspoons curry powder, 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 medium yellow onion finely chopped, 4 garlic cloves minced, 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger , 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 cup frozen peas (no need to thaw), ¼ cup plain low fat (2%) or whole Greek yogurt (do not use nonfat), ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro.
    <br>
    Instructions: 1. Sprinkle the chicken evenly with ¾ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon curry powder. \n 2. Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add the chicken in a single layer and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned but still pink in spots, about 3 minutes. Transfer the partially cooked chicken to a clean bowl and set aside. \n 3. Add the remaining 1½ tablespoons oil to the skillet and set heat to medium. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger and remaining 1½ teaspoons curry powder and cook until fragrant, about a minute more. \n 4. Whisk the chicken broth and cornstarch together to dissolve the cornstarch, then add to the skillet along with the sugar and ⅛ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and cook until the sauce is nicely thickened, about 5 minutes. \n 5. Add the peas and partially cooked chicken to the skillet, turn the heat down to low and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, a few minutes. Off the heat, stir in the yogurt and cilantro; then season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve with basmati rice.
