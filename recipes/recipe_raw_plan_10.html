  <h1>Recipe Raw Plan 10</h1>
  <h3>Goal: avocado toast</h3>

    <section class="plans">


    <p>
      Ingredients: 1 slice of bread, ½ ripe avocado, Pinch of salt.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Toast your slice of bread until golden and firm. \n 2. Remove the pit from your avocado. Use a big spoon to scoop out the flesh. Put it in a bowl and mash it up with a fork until it’s as smooth as you like it. Mix in a pinch of salt (about ⅛ teaspoon) and add more to taste, if desired. \n 3. Spread avocado on top of your toast. Enjoy as-is or top with any extras offered in this post (I highly recommend a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt, if you have it)
