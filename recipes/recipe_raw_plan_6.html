  <h1>Recipe Raw Plan 6</h1>
  <h3>Goal: fried rice</h3>

    <section class="plans">
    <p>
      Ingredients: 3 tablespoons butter, 2 large eggs, whisked, 2 medium carrots peeled and diced, 1 small white onion diced, 1/2 cup frozen peas, 3 cloves garlic minced, salt and black pepper, 4 cups cooked and chilled rice , 3 green onions thinly sliced, 3–4 tablespoons soy sauce or more to taste, 2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional), 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan* over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate. \n 2. Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and carrots are soft. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until melted. Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until combined. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring occasionally.  (I like to let the rice rest for a bit between stirs so that it can crisp up on the bottom.)  Then add in the eggs and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until combined.  Taste and season with extra soy sauce, if needed. \n 3. Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.

      Instructions: 1. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter into a large skillet. Add the eggs and scramble until fully cooked. Remove them from the pan and set aside. \n 2. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter into the pan. Add carrots and onion to the pan and cook until tender, 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for an additional minute. \n 3. Add in the cold rice and peas and sauté for 3-4 minutes. The rice should brown up a bit. \n 4. Add the eggs back to the pan and stir in soy sauce, oyster sauce and sesame oil.

      Ingredients: 1 1/2 c. long-grain rice (preferably jasmine) or about 2 1/2 c. leftover rice, 3 Tbsp. peanut or vegetable oil divided, 3 large eggs beaten to blend, 5 cloves garlic grated or finely chopped, 1 (1"") piece ginger finely chopped, 4 scallions thinly sliced, 2 Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp. granulated sugar, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. white pepper, 1/4 tsp. MSG, 1/3 c. frozen peas, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter cut into pieces
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Fill a large pot about halfway with water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, thoroughly rinse rice in a strainer until water runs almost clear. \n 2. Cook rice in boiling water 3 minutes, then drain with a fine-mesh strainer that fits in pot. Wipe out pot, pour in about 2"" water, and bring to a simmer. With rice in strainer, make a few divots in rice through to bottom of strainer with a chopstick or butter knife. \n 3. Cover strainer with foil, then place in pot over simmering water. Place pot lid over strainer; if there’s a lot of steam escaping, wrap foil or a damp tea towel around rim of pot and strainer. (This can also be done in a bamboo steamer or a standard steaming setup that won’t let the rice fall through.) \n 4. Steam until rice is cooked through but still slightly al dente, about 15 minutes; it should have a drier feel than normal steamed rice. Spread onto a baking sheet and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to use. \n 5. Heat a large wok or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat. Pour in 1 tablespoon oil and swirl wok to coat. Once oil is shimmering, add eggs and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until cooked through but not browning, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out wok. \n 6. In same wok over high heat, swirl remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cook garlic and ginger, tossing constantly, until fragrant and garlic begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Add white and pale green scallion parts and cook, tossing constantly, until softened, about 1 minute. Add rice and immediately toss to combine. Fry rice, stirring constantly, until no clumps remain and you begin to hear some light popping sounds from the rice toasting, 2 to 3 minutes. \n 7. Add soy sauce, granulated sugar, salt, pepper, and MSG and cook, tossing constantly, until soy sauce is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add eggs, peas, and dark green scallion parts and cook, tossing constantly, until warmed through and incorporated, about 2 minutes more. Add butter and cook, tossing, until melted, about 30 seconds more.

Try your best not to over cook the eggs. \n 3. After that, add the white rice into the skillet and drizzle it with a little more oil (about 1 tbs). Add the peas and stir everything together. Cook the rice in the skillet for about 2-4 minutes stirring frequently. \n 4. Next add the soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder.
