      Ingredients: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 4) cut into 1-inch pieces, 2 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning, 2 medium green bell peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips, 1 small yellow onion thinly sliced, 2 cloves garlic chopped, 12 ounces smooth penne , 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth, One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, 6 ounces cream cheese cubed and at room temperature, Kosher salt, 4 scallions sliced for serving.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Heat the oil in large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add  the chicken and Cajun seasoning and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken just starts to change color and the spices are toasted, about 2 minutes. \n 2. Add the peppers and onions and cook until they just begin to release some of their juices, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until softened, 1 minute. \n 3. Add the pasta, chicken broth and tomatoes and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce is thickened and reduced by about half, about 15 minutes. \n 4. Remove from the heat and add the cream cheese and 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt. Stir until the cream cheese is combined and melted. Don't worry if the sauce looks runny, it will thicken as it sits. Top with sliced scallions.

      Ingredients: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 4 cloves garlic thinly sliced, 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, Two 28-ounce cans plum tomatoes, crushed by hand, 1 cup chopped fresh basil, plus 4 large fresh basil sprigs, 1 pound dried rigatoni, 1 pound spicy Italian sausage, casings removed, 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella, 1 1/2 cups shredded provolone, 1 cup grated Parmesan.
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. \n 2. Bring a large pot   of salted water to a boil. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add both cans of the tomatoes and 1 cup water. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat slightly, add the basil sprigs and simmer rapidly, uncovered, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard basil and stir in the chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper. \n 3. While the sauce simmers, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon, until brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a large bowl with a slotted spoon. \n 4. Cook the rigatoni in the salted boiling water until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions instruct. Drain the pasta and add it to the large bowl. \n 5. Add the tomato sauce and half each of the mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan cheeses to the bowl and stir well to combine. Transfer the pasta-sausage mixture to a 3- to 4-quart baking dish and top with the remaining mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan cheeses. Bake, uncovered, until browned, about 15 minutes. Let the pasta rest about 10 minutes before serving.

      Ingredients: 2 pints (20 ounces) cherry tomatoes, 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, One 8-ounce block feta cheese drained, 10 ounces mezze rigatoni, 1 clove garlic finely grated, Pinch crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves thinly sliced, Flaky sea salt for serving
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. \n 2. Toss the cherry tomatoes and olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Transfer to a 2 1/2- to  3-quart baking dish, place the feta in the center of the tomatoes and season with a pinch of black pepper. Bake until the tomatoes have burst and the feta has softened, about 30 minutes. Raise the heat to 450 degrees F and continue to cook until the tomatoes and feta are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. \n 3.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 13 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then thoroughly drain the pasta.  \n 4. As soon as the tomatoes and feta come out of the oven, stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using). Use the back of a spoon to smash the tomatoes and feta into a smooth and creamy sauce (it’s okay if some of the oil isn’t fully integrated). Add the pasta and half the basil and toss until evenly coated. If the sauce is too thick, stir in some pasta water a couple tablespoons at a time. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve topped with the remaining basil and a pinch of sea salt.

      Ingredients: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 12 ounces fettuccine, Olive oil for tossing, 12 ounces boneless skinless chicken breast (about 2), 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, 2 cups heavy cream, 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg, 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
      <br>
      Instructions: 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil. \n   2. Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper. \n 3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl. \n 4. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm. \n 5. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.
